# adjustableViewHeightsProgrammatic

This project helps you understand the basic tricks of using NSLayoutConstraints. There is a superview which resizes dynamically 
based on the subviews. 

The subviews here are a UIButton and a UIImageView. On clicking the button, the image will appear within the view and with every 
click the image scales up 10 pixels. Also the button is dynamically resizable based on the content. For now it is only resizing 
horizontally. (working on resizing this image vertically)
